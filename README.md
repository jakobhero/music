# Script to convert important ID3-tags to lowercase
Simple script to convert MP3 ID3-tags to lowercase because I have OCPD when it comes to my music library.
## Prerequisites
Before you can run this script, the following requirement must be met:
* You have installed the mp3-tagger Python module with `pip install mp3-tagger`
## Using the ID3-Tag converter
In order to use the tag converter, clone this repository and run `python tag_converter.py`. The script transforms the following ID3-tags of all mp3-files in the current folder:
* artist
* band
* album
* song
